        <p>
          Hi! I'm an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm interested in the unlimited things that's possible through software engineering. On this website I will be occasionally posting projects that I've been working on. This is my journey through trial and error while working on projects that pique my interest. Hopefully, my growth and struggles can help others who are also aspiring to be a better developer!
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I like to watch youtube videos(where I get my inspiration from), read books and hang out with friends!
