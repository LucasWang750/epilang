My first Hackathon ever was with CodeDay. I was fresh to coding and had never coded a game from scratch before. I have not even created console apps or anything of the sort yet. I met with a group of enthusiastic programmers from the area that wanted to create a top down tank survival game in Unity. Since I had no experience in Unity or C++, I was not in charge of the programming portion. I created all of sprites and background and sound effects for our game. I entered my first hackathon with lots of anxiety about my programming level but I left with wholesome teamwork and a working game.
