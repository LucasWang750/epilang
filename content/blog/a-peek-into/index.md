For the AP Computer Science Principles class during my Sophomore year in High School, we were required to build an original project in Code.org for the AP test. This class was my first contact for programming and I had no idea what I was doing at the point.

Code.org is a free non-profit website for k-12 students to learn computer science in a drag-n-drop block based programming environment. They offer Code Studio, Hour of Code and many more. 

For the AP CSP project, I used Code Studio to create an app where the player gets to control a starship and shoot bullets at enemy ships that spawn in random locations at the top.

For my first programming project that my partner and I built from the ground up, I felt proud of it. Looking back, the controls are janky, the bullet system is not great, and enemy ships are too easy to eliminate.

I’m nobody’s taxi service; I’m not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there’s an escaped fish. It’s art! A statement on modern society, ‘Oh Ain’t Modern Society Awful?’!

It’s art! A statement on modern society, ‘Oh Ain’t Modern Society Awful?’! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Did I mention we have comfy chairs? All I’ve got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
