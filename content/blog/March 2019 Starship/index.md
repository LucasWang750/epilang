For the AP Computer Science Principles class during my Sophomore year in High School, we were required to build an original project in Code.org for the AP test. This class was my first contact for programming and I had no idea what I was doing at the point.

Code.org is a free non-profit website for k-12 students to learn computer science in a drag-n-drop block based programming environment. They offer Code Studio, Hour of Code and many more. 

For the AP CSP project, I used Code.org App Studio to create an app where the player gets to control a starship and shoot bullets at enemy ships that spawn in random locations at the top.

For my first programming project that my partner and I built from the ground up, I felt proud of it. Looking back, the controls are janky, the bullet system is not great, and enemy ships are too easy to eliminate.
